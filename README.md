An Android app that will allow you to generate the bill amount of hydro consumption as follows.

• Ask the user to input On-peak usage, Off-peak usage and Mid-peak usage. All three inputs indicate usage in kWh having Double/Float values. You must show appropriate keyboard for all the inputs.
• Calculate the following charges when “Calculate Hydro” button is clicked and display it to the user as per shown in snap.
o The charges for on-peak usage is $0.132/kWh, for off-peak usage it is $0.065/kWh and for mid-peak usage it is $0.094/kWh.
o The total consumption charges are combined total of on-peak charges, off-peak charges and mid-peak charges.
o The HST is 13% of the total consumption charges.
o The provincial rebate(discount) is 8% of the total consumption charges.
o Total regulatory charges are HST – provincial rebate.
o The actual bill amount is total consumption charges + total regulatory charges.
• You must use the ConstraintLayout (or LinearLayout) to design your app. Your app UI must look neat, clean and professional. Feel free to improve on the layout shown.
